# Countdown-timer

This is a simple countdown timer made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I forked this from https://github.com/PrajaktaSathe/Countdown-timer and used the styling from https://breewitched.github.io/notion/christmascountdown.html

The countdown can be found at https://jckett.github.io/Countdown-timer/
